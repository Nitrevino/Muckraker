     <p>In 1906, Upton Sinclair wrote a novel called The Jungle that exposed Chicago's industrialized meatpacking plants dreadful conditions.  This novel helped inspire a series of health and safety legislation, like the “Pure Food and Drug” and the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Sinclair's Socialist compassion towards workers inspired his description of factory life. Today, the industrialized meat industry’s poor sanitation and inhumane treatment of animals shows that we still need progressive legislation. </p>

    <blockquote>

    “As if political liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable!”
    ― Upton Sinclair, The Jungle

            <div align="center"><p> “Into this wild-beast tangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken part in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was no disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were loaded. They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars.”
                ― Upton Sinclair, The Jungle
