      <H2>Who was he? </H2>
     
<p>In 1906, Upton Sinclair wrote a novel exposing the dreadful conditions of chicago's industrialized meatpacking plants. This novel helped inspire a series of health and safety legislation, like the “Pure Food and Drug” and the Federal Meat Inspection Act. While the jungle did greatly improve meat sanitation standards, the industrialized meat industry’s poor sanitation and inhumane treatment of animals means there progressive legislation is still needed.The Jungle reflects his Socialist compassion towards workers in every description of factory life.</p>

They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars.”
