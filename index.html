    <p align=center>"There are in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave evils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them. There should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man, whether politician or business man, every evil practice, whether in politics, business, or social life. I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform or in a book, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful."</p>

<!-- I consulted <a href ="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-woman-who-took-on-the-tycoon-651396/" > this</a> website to help me design my practice website. A few elements that make it really good are its attention mix of clarifying photos with captions, sources, and linked within the text that link to other pages with more information.  -->
