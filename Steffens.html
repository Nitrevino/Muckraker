<H2> Quotes </H2>


The longer I live, the more I feel that the individual is not so much to blame - not even the worst individuals, not even the 'best' citizens - as the system of corruption which has grown up about us, and which rewards an honest man with a mere living and a crook with all the magnificence of our magnificent modern life. Lincoln Steffens


The misgovernment of the American people is misgovernment by the American people.
Lincoln Steffens


Nothing is done. Everything in the world remains to be done or done over.
Lincoln Steffens
