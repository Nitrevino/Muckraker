 <div align="center"> <p> Lincoln Steffens began his career covering police corruption, urban politics, and progressive reform efforts. His work exposed and helped defeat many corrupt New York political candidates within the Tammany Hall Network. His work focused on state capitals's political machinations, and he sought to answer how effectively politicians represented their constituencies views.
     
     
     
     Later in life, his cynicism over the “system's” unwillingness to reform, and his wife's death pushed him into a semi-nomadic life, and ended his muckraking career.</p></div>

  <blockquote>
         <div align="center"><p>
"The longer I live, the more I feel that the individual is not so much to blame - not even the worst individuals, not even the 'best' citizens - as the system of corruption which has grown up about us, and which rewards an honest man with a mere living and a crook with all the magnificence of our magnificent modern life."
</div>
         
   <div align="center"><p>
"The misgovernment of the American people is misgovernment by the American people."

</div>

   <div align="center"><p>
"Nothing is done.  Everything in the world remains to be done or done over."
