    <H2> Who She Was:</H2>

 <p> At Age 14, Standard Oil Company used its growing market share to pressure Ida Tarbell’s father to sell their small business. This started her life long investigation into Standard Oil company that eventually crumbled one of the World’s largest monopolies. Her work revealed collusion between Standard Oil company, rail road barons, and smaller oil companies to strangle their competition, and raise prices for consumers. Her work ultimately culminated  in a supreme court decision that ruled that Rockefeller oil company violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, and it was split into to seperate companies. She didn’t play around. She said this about Rockefeller (but it applies perfectly to Trump).

  <blockquote>



          <p>“If it has taught us anything, it is that our present law-makers, as a body, are ignorant, corrupt and unprincipled; that the majority of them are, directly or indirectly, under the control of the very monopolies against whose acts we have been seeking relief." Ida Tarbel, 1904 </p>
          </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      
        <p>"Mr. Rockefeller is a hypocrite. This man has for 40 years lent all the power of his great ability to perpetuating and elaborating a system of illegal and unjust discrimination by common carriers. He has done more than any other person to fasten on this country the most serious interference with free individual development which it suffers, an interference which, today, the whole country is struggling vainly to strike off, which it is doubtful will be cured, so deep-seated and so subtle is it, except by revolutionary methods."</p>

              <blockquote>
        
          <p>"It does not pay. Our national life is on every side distinctly poorer, uglier, meaner, for the kind of influence he exercises."</p>
